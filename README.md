# GoCD task plugin for creating archives

This is merely a skeleton plugin that plugin developers can fork to get quickly 
started with writing task plugins for GoCD. It works out of the box, but you should change 
it to do something besides executing `curl`.
 
All the documentation is hosted at https://plugin-api.gocd.io/current/tasks.



## Getting started

The installer process creates an archive (.zip, .tar, .tar.gz) from a list of files. All files are flatten in the archive.

- *Data Source Pattern*: A comma separated list of files, that should by archived. The Pattern allows to define a file or a folder, that should be included into the assembly. Optionally following syntax is possible: path{[bin]/*.exe}. This will catch all EXE files from the *path* and include them into the archive into the folder *bin* 
- *Data Target Pattern*: The archive name, the task will recognize the archive type from the file name.


## Building the code base

To build the jar, run `./gradlew clean test assemble`
